            "text": "## Description\nEmerald Playa Beach is a popular kite spot due to its beautify scenery, tourist friendly accommodations,  local kite shop, and good kiting conditions. \n\n## Getting There\nAfter flying into Puerto Princessa airport, it takes over 30 minutes of dirt roads to get to this spot. This is a bit too long for hopping into a trike. If you are staying in the Microtel, they can arrange for a free shuttle ride. Otherwise, you might try grabbing a taxi at the airport, but make sure to negotiate the price.\n\n## Accomodations\nEmerald Beach is pretty far outside of town, which significantly limits the options for those without transportation. The Microtel is a great choice for those on vacation who want the amenities offered by the hotel, such as an amazing complimentary breakfast, pool, and airport shuttle. For those looking for a more authentic and cheaper alternative, there is a cluster of small cabins adjacent to the Microtel that are available to rent through popular online booking sites. These cabins, while small, are a great get-away experience for couples and include air-conditioning, plumbing, and incredible wifi! \n\n## Kite Club Palawan\nThe kite club sits right on the beach, directly in-between the Microtel and cabins. They offer affordable lessons, but the gear rental is pricy. Even if you are not employing their service, they are usually generous enough to loan you a pump and even have a local person to help you launch/land your kite free of charge.\n\n## Conditions\nThe water is shallow in a large region around the beach, with a noticeable shift in tint as you move out to deeper parts. Not every day at Emerald Beach is a kiting day. However, during the windy season, you can expect at least a few good kiting days per week with consistent wind and kite sizes between 9-14m. In fact, the wind around Peurto Princessa tends to be better than that found on the north side of Palawan due to the lack of neighboring islands in this area, which allows wind to flow unobstructed.\n\n## Hazards\nThe biggest concern while kiting is to avoid the rocky areas. There is a large rocky area on the north side of the beach, so be sure to ask locals to point it out before launching. There are also other obstacles such as boats and sand-bars to watch out for. Sea urchins are a known issue in the area, although they are typically only encountered in deeper water. Booties are recommended. \n\n",

            "text": "## Description\nSkyway is primary destination for kiters around the St. Petersburg area. This spot sits on the west side of Skyway bridge in a wooded rest area.\n\n## Getting There\nIf you are traveling south on Skyway bridge, this spot is situated in the first rest area after the toll booth. Its possible to see kites out on the water while driving on the bridge. Even if there are signs that say that the rest area is closed, you can still exit. After exiting, there is an intersection that goes either to the west side or the east side. Drive all the way down the service road on the west side, and the road will end at a small beach. You can park off the beach or anywhere in the wooded area.\n\n## Launching\nThe launch area is a relatively small beach, and this spot can get very crowded on a windy day. Luckily, its usually only kiters here, without too many other beach goers. Try to get rigged up and launched quickly before someone lays their lines over yours.\n\n## Water\nThe kiteboarding area is large, including the entire region around the rest area and stretching out further beyond the channel if you want more space. The bottom is mostly muddy with an occasional sand bar. The protection inside the bay and these sand bars keeps the water relatively flat and shallow around the rest area.\n\n## Wind\nAs one would expect, the west side of Skyway is best on a west wind. For south-west it can be good, but its a toss-up between this spot and Fort Desoto, depending on exactly how westerly the wind is. For a north-west wind, it can also work, but there is a large island just north-west of this spot that can cause obstruction or a wind-shadow. For any winds from the east, head across the street to the east side of Skyway.\n\n",

            "text": "## Description\nThis bayside beach in Daphne is accessible through park nature trails and is commonly referred to by local kiteboarders as Daphne Nature Trail.\n\n## Getting There\nThere are three trails that can be used to accessed the beach. The closest begins in the parking lot in Bayfront Park. However, as of March 2018, this trail is closed for repairs to a bridge. There is also a parking lot entrance at Village Point. While the hike through the woods is easy, it is about 15 minutes walk to the beach, so don't forget your pump. Both of these lots offer free parking. There is a third entrance at the cul-de-sac in the Harbor Place neighborhood. However, this entrance is gated and only accessible by Harbor Place residents. \n\n## Wind\nThis spot is best for kiteboarding wind from the west. An offshore wind will be gusty and could leave you stranded in Mobile Bay. One could walk south from the pier to where the beach curves around, which might be good for a southerly wind. However, there are lots of broken piers and posts in the water in that area. Also, the southern part of the beach is mostly private.\n\n## Precautions\nThis beach is not an incredibly popular destination for local beach goers, but remember that pedestrians always have the right of way. Also, keep an eye out for gators, which frequent the eastern shore side of the bay.\n\n",

            "text": "## Description\nThis bay area bordered by the Big Sabine peninsula is frequently a hot spot for local kiterboarders. It is the most popular spot on the sound-side of Pensacola Beach and often referred to as simply, \"Big Sabine\".\n\n## Getting There\nDrive down Pensacola Beach until you see the \"Welcome to Pensacola Beach\" sign. Here, you can park on the side of the road. However, be careful of deep sand, because your vehicle can easily get stuck. There are usually small patches of gravel where the sand is shallow and safe to park. It is a short walk out to the bay.\n\n## Launching\nThis area is typically free of beach-goers. The beach at the waters edge is small without much space to launch. Most kiters will rig, launch, and land in the large sandy space just south of the water. However, the sand is covered with small, sharp seashells. Self-launching directly off the sand is not advisable, as they will rip through the leading edge. Alternatively, there is a small path through the west side that leads out to a sand bar. While the size of the sand bar depends on conditions (and the last hurricane), it may be big enough to use for self-launching.\n\n## Wind\nThis spot is great for an on-shore northerly or easterly wind. Its even better with an offshore wind from the south-east. Even with a off-shore wind, this spot is generally safe to kite due to the shallow water and down-wind protection of Big Sabine point. Kiters experienced with staying upwind can enjoy the smooth surf of an off-shore wind with the peace-of-mind offered by the sand bars. Wind directly from the west is likely to get severely obstructed as it makes its way over land and large sand dunes.\n\n## Precautions\nDespite the shallow water of Big Sabine Point, there is a deep channel that cuts right in front of the beach, visible from the map. This water is too deep to stand and may cause difficulty for beginners. Small jelly fish can be a nuisance depending on the season. Keep an out for the large man-o-war jelly fish. Although they are normally only found in the gulf, they have spotted in bay waters as well. Sting rays are a constant hazard and may attack if threatened. Booties are recommended, especially due to the shells on the beach. Do not walk/jump/launch on dunes, as this area is preserved for local wildlife, and their nesting areas should not be disrupted.\n\n## Lessons\nIf you are looking for kiteboarding instruction in the area, give Jon Davies a call at (904) 868-1141. He is a local expert and has been teaching beginners to advanced kiters for many years. Let him know if you are in the market for some new gear.\n\n",

            "text": "## Description\nLeeside is probably the most popular kiteboarding spot in the entire Florida panhandle owing to its smooth flats, waist-deep water, and protection from gulf currents. It is a great spot for beginners and is the primary teaching location for many kite schools in the area.\n\n## Getting There\nAfter crossing the bridge from Fort Walton, continue past Beasley Park on your right, and soon after there will be a small gated entrance on the north side with a sign that says \"Okaloosa Area - Gulf Islands National Seashore\". This entrance leads to a large parking lot next to the beach. \n\n## Parking\nParking in the lot beyond the gates requires payment of the parking fee. The parking fee operates on the honor system, and according to locals, \"no one actually pays it.\" However, if you don't pay, you may receive a notice on your windshield that politely reminds you to pay. If you decide to pay, there is a small metal box near the entrance of the parking lot where you can deposit the fee and take a slip to display on your dash as proof of payment. Locals may consider purchasing the Gulf Islands National Seashore Annual Pass online, which provides access to many beaches and tolls along the gulf coast. As an alternative, there is a small gravel area on the gulf-side of the road, just across the street from the spot, where payment is not required. It is recommended that you do not park in front of the gates leading into the lot, as you may block the signs, and the rangers may ask you to move.\n\n## Launching\nThere is enough space along the beach to layout lines and rig up. However, the beach can become very crowded, especially on the weekends. Do not launch in an area that might endanger other beach-goers should something go wrong. Instead, walk up the beach away from others, or consider wading out into the shallow water.\n\n## Water\nThe water is only waist-deep and sandy in a large area extending out from the beach. There is a boat channel further out in the bay and those venturing into deeper water will need to keep an eye out for traffic.\n\n## Wind\nThe best wind for Leeside is southerly. South and south-east wind leaves the bay water buttery smooth and comes across the beach without significant obstruction. Don't let offshore wind deter you from kiting this spot, as the region of shallow water is large enough so that you can always walk back upwind. Also, there are usually enough kiters around that you won't be the only one kiting. North and east winds can work as well. The worst winds are from the west and south-west due to obstruction from the land and buildings. For these winds, you are probably better off trying the gulf side at Beasley Park.\n\n## Park Rules\nThe park opens at 8am and closes at sunset. The exact time of sunset is determined by the rangers, don't make them kick you out. Beach-goers always have the right-of-way, kite this spot as if you were local. \n\n",

            "text": "## Description\nOne of the favorite kiteboarding spots for those around St. Petersburg, East Beach in Fort De Soto is essentially a watering hole for kiters. Because the beach is not very nice, this has become kiter territory, where kites have the right-of-way. Great spot for beginners.\n\n## Getting There\nGetting into Fort De Soto will require two bridge tolls totaling $1.75, and a park fee of $5.\n\n## Wind\nThis spot works well for southerly and south-east winds. South-west can work as well, but the wind is side-on and the trees can create a wind-shadow on the beach making it difficult to launch. For south-west, you might consider saving yourself the park fee and head to Skyway instead.\n\n## Water\nThe kiting area is large, extending along the length of the beach and stretching out past the point. The area near shore is shallow and muddy. Getting out further, there is a large sandbar with nice flat water. Once you get past the sandbar, the water suddenly gets much deeper and choppier.\n\n## Launching\nThe launch area is large with lots of space to layout lines and rig up. The main drawback is that the beach has grass and debris that may catch your lines.\n\n",

            "text": "## Description\nWhile certainly not the most popular spot in the area, the advantages of kiting along the Gulf Breeze Seashore include avoiding the beach crowd and nice on-shore southerlies without having to brave the gulf. Besides a few fishermen, you will likely have the spot to yourself.\n\n## Getting There\nIf you are heading East on Gulf Breeze Parkway, then just as you enter the preservation, there will be a small parking lot on the right side of the road. This lot is large enough for about 6 vehicle to park at the tree line. Don't blink or you'll miss it and have to drive a mile down the road to pull a U-turn. From the parking lot, its a short walk through the trail down to the beach.\n\n## Launching\nThe beach is not very large, but with someone to help launch, there won't be much of an issue. Self-launching is definitely not recommended, as there are lots of trees and bushes right off the shore. The water is sufficiently shallow for drift launching, and this is preferable to self-launching directly off the beach.\n\n## Wind\nThe primary reason for kiting at this spot would be to take advantage of a southerly at a location that is on-shore, and not in the gulf. For a side-on wind, there are spots along the sound-side of Pensacola Beach that are probably preferable.\n\n## Precaution\nDon't confuse this spot with the small beach at the Gulf Islands National Seashore offices, which is less than a mile down to road to the East. Kiteboarding is restricted at that location as it has been deemed destructive to the nesting areas of local wildlife.. Legend has it that some idiot wrapped his kite around a tree, resulting in a quick and decisive ban on kiteboarding that is strictly enforced. Of course, be careful not to do the same thing at this spot. Also, don't be too surprised if a ranger tries to run you off.\n\n",

The closest begins in the parking lot in Bayfront Park. However, as of March 2018, this trail is closed for repairs to a bridge. There is also a parking lot entrance at Village Point. While the hike through the woods is easy, it is about 15 minutes walk to the beach, so don't forget your pump. Both of these lots offer free parking. There is a third entrance at the cul-de-sac in the Harbor Place neighborhood. However, this entrance is gated and only accessible by Harbor Place residents. \n\n## Wind\nThis spot is best for kiteboarding wind from the west. An offshore wind will be gusty and could leave you stranded in Mobile Bay. One could walk south from the pier to where the beach curves around, which might be good for a southerly wind. However, there are lots of broken piers and posts in the water in that area. Also, the southern part of the beach is mostly private.\n\n## Precautions\nThis beach is not an incredibly popular destination for local beach goers, but remember that pedestrians always have the right of way. Also, keep an eye out for gators, which frequent the eastern shore side of the bay.\n\n",

            "text": "## Description\nKite Island offers premier kiteboarding on the Jersey Shore. It is notorious for its expansive region of flat, waist-heigh water. A great spot for learning and even better for practicing tricks, no body-dragging necessary. Unfortunately, as one might expect, the island is only accessible by boat.\n\n## Getting There\nThe island is around a 20 minute boat ride from the west side of Barnegat Bay. GreenHatKiteboarding is a local establishment that offers two-way boat rides for experienced kiters at about 100 USD. Local residents visit this spot via their own water craft. Be wary of a falling tide and shallow water if anchoring near the island.\n\n## Launching\nThere is a small beach area on the southern side of the island. The northern side is covered in thick brush and wildlife. On a nice windy day, there is almost always someone there to help you launch. Unfortunately, there is a lot of debris in the sand, and you may need to run the lines a few times before launching just to untangle branches, shrubs, and dead birds.\n\n## What to bring?\nDon't get stuck on an island without a kite. Bring every kite/board size that you may need in case of unexpected changes in the forecast. As for the wetsuit, GreenHat recommends a 4/3mm for April, May, October; a 3/2mm for May, June, September; and board shorts for July, August. Other considerations would be bug repellant, sunscreen, snacks, and beer.\n\n## Kiteboarding\nIt is recommended that you stay in the region south of island. This southern region is flat and shallow, even at a significant distance from the island. On the other hand, water gets much deeper around the north and west sides of the island. Beware of kiteboarding too close to the island, as the water is very shallow. Catching a fin in 4 inches of water is not fun for you of those below your kite.\n\n",

            "text": "## Description\nAt the west end of Dauphin Island is a public beach that stretches for miles. The Gulf is on one side and the Mississippi Sound is on the other. Both sides are great for kiting, but more advanced kiters may prefer the waves on the Gulf side, while less experienced kiters will appreciate the protected waters on the Sound side. WARNING: THIS SPOT IS CURRENTLY CLOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION DUE TO STORM ACTIVITY. ONLY THOSE STAYING IN HOUSES BEYOND THE CHECKPOINT WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THIS SPOT.\n\n## Getting There\nThe West End is located at the very end of a long two-lane road that stretches across half the island. This road dead-ends into a parking lot that offers free parking and easy access to the public beaches.\n\n## The Sound Side\nThe northern side of this spot is definitely more popular than the southern side. Its arguably the best kite spot on the island for on-shore winds from the north. Unfortunately, the beach is very small on this side, almost non-existent. Most kiters will launch in a small area adjacent to the parking lot and walk out to the water. The surf can become pretty choppy in stronger wind, despite being in protected water. Avoid walking in the brush, as this is protected as a nesting area for local wildlife.\n\n## The Gulf Side\nThe southern side benefits from a very large beach with white sand that stretches as far as the eye can see. There is always ample space to stretch out your lines without interference. Wind from the south will create small barrels for those who are seeking a bit more excitement. Off-shore wind usually results in relatively flat surf. There are not many kiters who frequent the gulf side. Watch out for glass in the sand that can wash up onto the shore.\n\n",

            "text": "## Description\nThere is a large section of Delray beach that is allocated specifically for kiteboarding. Locals refer to this spot as simply \"Kite Beach\" even though there a similarly named spots up and down Florida's east coast.\n\n## Getting There\nThe primary access point to the beach is at the end of Casuarina Road. There is enough space here to temporarily park your vehicle and unload gear before finding parking elsewhere. One on the beach, walk south, past the beach club and all of the lounge chairs. There is a small sign on the beach at the edge of the brush that says \"Kiteboarding beyond this point only.\" Chances are you will see lots of other kites.\n\n## Parking\nThere is ample street parking along the side of the road that stretches all the way down the beach. If this fills up too quickly there are small, public lots nearby. These include the Anchor Park lot right across the street as well as the Sandoway Lot a couple blocks down. Parking is metered and costs $1.50/hour. You can pay with credit.\n\n## Precautions\nThe primary precaution will be to steer clear of other beach goers and swimmers. Although Kite Beach is fairly separated from the other people, there may be some walkers taking a stroll through the launch area. After kiting out, you may travel up and down the beach, but stay far enough out to avoid swimmers. Do not kite too close to the beach! Do not try to land your kite around families and life guards! Any accidents could potentially result in a ban on kiteboarding at this beach. \n\n",

After crossing the bridge, the spot will be on the right. You will be able to see kites and windsurfers. You can park anywhere in the grassy region.\n\n## Wind\nThe causeway is best for a north-west or north-east wind. It can also work for a northerly wind, but there is a large island just north of the spot, Fisherman Key, that will cause some obstruction. For a north-east wind, you may also consider kiting at the Sanibel Lighthouse.\n\n## Water\nThere is a deep channel that runs just in front of the beach. Once you get past the channel, closer to the island, the water becomes shallow and sandy.\n\n## Precautions\nAt the far western point of the island, Fisherman Key, there is a large oyster bed, where the sharp shells of oysters cover the bay floor. Is it recommended that you avoid this spot so that you do not cut yourself on the shells in case of a crash. The bed can be easily spotted as a black area on the map, and even while kiting, the water appears noticeably darker. Jelly fish can become a nuisance during the summer season, beginning around May. Be cautious while launching, there are trees and a causeway nearby. If there are lots of kiters and windsurfers out at the same time, the convention is that kiters stay downwind of the windsurfers to avoid kite lines catching on a mast.\n\n",

It is a popular destination for those looking for buttery smooth water away from the crowds of Pensacola beach.\n\n## Getting There By Foot\nBig Sabine is located about midway between Pensacola Beach and Navarre. There is a parking lot not far from the spot, however you are better off passing the lot and parking on the side of the road. From there, you will have to hike through rolling dunes and brush with all of your gear in tow. This hike will take around 15 minutes, assuming that you don't get lost in the dunes. The best walking path to the pool is to head straight up from the road and hit the water line far to the west of the spot. From there, you head north-east, following the small beach path. Anywhere that you see green brush on the map is practically unnavigable by foot, and its best to avoid the swamp altogether.\n\n## Launching\nUnfortunately, there is not much beach for launching. There is a very narrow beach on the west side, but you may be better off walking up to the north side where there is a much nicer beach. \n\n## Wind\nDue to its enclosed nature, Big Sabine is great for wind from the North, East, or West. However, it is bordered by large dunes to the south that will likely obstruct southerly wind.\n\n",

There are multiple kite schools established on the beach, and the flat protected water makes this a good place for learning. However, the beach has been partitioned into multiple sections that you should be aware of before you make a trip.\n\n## Beach Partitions\nThe entire northern stretch of beach has been claimed, somewhat dubiously, by the kite schools. Although each school is allocated a small section of the beach in which to operate, they are slightly spread out from each other, which makes it difficult for tourist to share this space. Furthermore, the kite schools will charge you for using their sections of the beach. Technically, they can only charge for using their services, such as pumps, assistance, and rescue, but good luck trying to kite in their territory without first purchasing their services. Below the kite schools, on the western stretch of beach, is a large swim area where kites are not permitted. This area is indicated by balloons. Below this, in the small corner on the southern part of the beach, is the only space left for visiting kiters.  Unfortunately, this area is fairly rocky.\n\n",

            "text": "## Description\nFriendship is a popular place to combine kiting with a relaxing getaway. The surroundings are beautiful, with turquoise water, islands in the distance, boats sailing around the bay, and even the big Buddha in the background. \n\n## Accomodations\nThere is a small resort called Sabai Cabins that was almost made for kite boarders. The cabins are relatively inexpensive when considering Phuket prices, and they area just large enough to comfortably accommodate a small crew of 2-4 kiters. They sit in a small courtyard lined with coconut trees  directly adjacent to the beach. They have a close relationship with KiteZone Phucket next door so that you can easily access their services during your stay. While the cabins are not super luxurious, they are clean and offer basic amenities. There are places to eat in the surrounding area, but not too much to do within walking distance. You will probably want to rent a scooter for getting around.\n\n## Hazards\nThe water is very shallow in the area around friendship beach and covered in rock patches. At high tide, you can see one large rock patch, which is easy to avoid. As the tide goes out, you will begin to see how many rocks are hiding just below the surface. Be wary where you jump, one bad fall could mean a fractured skull. At low tide, the entire area empties out, and the beach extends out nearly to the boat channel. Most kiters come in during low tide. \n\n## Kiting\nThe beginner kiters usually cluster near the shore, meaning that more advanced riders will need to navigate an obstacle course of students and crashing kites in order to make it out to clearer flats. But, once you get away from land, you will be treated to a nice view of the big buddha statue perched off in the distance to the west. This area is fairly protected by surrounding land mass, meaning that its unusual for wind to get through unobstructed. The wind tends to be fairly light, so bring a big kite.\n\n",

            "text": "## Description\nThe Cove is the most popular kite spot on Dauphin Island. It is distinguished by the natural sandbar formations that provide nearly 360 degree protection from the Gulf surf and relatively flat water. Locals sometimes refer to this spot as \"The Golf Course\" due to its proximity to Isle Dauphin Golf Course.\n\n## Getting There\nThe spot is easily accessible by vehicle. There is ample parking adjacent to the golf course, although drivers may be required to pay a small fee during the summer season and weekends. Once parked, there is a small boardwalk leading down to the beach. The island is known to close occasionally after severe storms or large events, so be sure to check before making a long drive down.\n\n## Wind\nDue to positioning, wind coming from the North or West is obstructed by the island and puts the cove in a wind shadow. This means that kiters are only found here for wind coming from the South or East. South-east is typically favorable as the wind comes through the inlet largely unobstructed. For Northern winds, try the West Side of the island. Overall, the wind around the island is light, and this is only exacerbated by the sand bar. Average kite size is around 15m with some riders commonly investing in larger foil kites and foil boards.\n\n## Launching\nThe primary concern when launching is the size of the beach. Although it stretches around the cove, the beach is very narrow and doesn't allow for lots of room to run lines and get perfect positioning. But this isn't a huge issue, as kiters typically wade out into the water during East/South-east winds, while the kite is launched from the beach. The water is sufficiently shallow for wading, but can make landing the kite slightly more difficult in very heavy winds. There is a small, sandy area directly adjacent to the restaurant/hotel that can be used if you absolutely need more room to rig, launch, or land. Be sure to avoid walking in the brush while launching/landing, as this area is preserved as a nesting ground for local wildlife. Also, it has lots of sand burs. The beach can become crowded on weekends with families and fishermen, but its always possible to find a safe area to launch if you're just willing to walk down the beach.\n\n## Hazards\nThe cove has deep water in the center, so touching the bottom is only possible near the edges. Weaker swimmers will want to bring along a life vest. The current is not very strong, however the water can become very choppy at the gulf inlet so beginner riders will probably want to keep some distance from the inlet. Small sting rays can be seen swimming near the beaches, sometimes by the dozen. Although they are not aggressive, they are curious and can attack if threatened. Booties are recommended, especially if launching from the water. Depending on the season, jelly fish can become a nuisance, but nothing too severe. Sharks are not known to be an issue. Avoid walking into the brush at the ends of the beach as this is a preservation area and also chalk full of sand burs. This spot is very much a newbie-friendly spot, so beware of beginners, especially since most of the local kiters have not had any formal lessons. The water is cold enough to require a wet suit from November to February, and may be preferred for October and March depending on the weather and rider.\n\n",
